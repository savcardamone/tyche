* Intel SIMD

There are a number of SIMD instruction sets which Intel has developed since the 
Pentium III in 1999 (note that we're ignoring the MMX instruction set, introduced
in the P5-based Pentium processors of 1997). Each successive development is 
backwards-compatible, and  we'll enumerate the main features here:

** Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE)

Comprises 70 instructions, most operating on single precision floating point 
data. Eight 128-bit registers (xmm0 through xmm7), the processing unit 
consequently supporting four-lane 32-bit SIMD.

** Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 (SSE2)

Supports double-precision floating point for all SSE operations, and enables SIMD
maths on any data types (from 8-bit integer ro 64-bit floating point). AMD's 
implementation of SSE2 doubled the number of registers from SSE (xmm0 through 
xmm15), which Intel subsequently adopted in 2004 for the x86-64 architecture.

** Streaming SIMD Extensions 3 (SSE3)

Incremental upgrate to SSE2. Addition of some DSP-oriented instructions, and
allows addition or multiplication of numbers within the same vector register
("horizontal" SIMD to use Intel's parlance).

** Supplemental Streaming SIMD Extensions 3 (SSSE3)

Upgrade to SSE3. Added ability to permute bytes in a word, multiplication of
16-bit fixed point numbers and accumulate instructions.

** Streaming SIMD Extensions 4 (SSE4)

Addition of more instructions, in particular a dot product for AoS data.

** Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX)

Sixteen ymm registers, each one 256 bits is width. To ensure 
backwards-compatibility with SSE, the lower 128 bits of the ymm registers can
be used as xmm registers. Introduced a three-operand SIMD instruction format
so the destination register could be set as separate to the two source registers,
i.e. the support of non-destructive SIMD. Some SSE instructions were extended to
the 256-bit cases, and a few new instructions added.

** Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (AVX2)

Expansion of the AVX instruction set, including three-operand fused 
multiply-accumulate and various register shuffling operations

** Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (AVX-512)

512-bit extensions to the AVX instruction set (32 512-bit wide vector registers 
named zmm0 through to zmm31: the lower 256 bits of these registers can be used 
by AVX instructions, and the lower 128 bits by SSE). Plenty of new instructions.
