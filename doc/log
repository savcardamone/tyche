* Roadmap

** Stage 1

*** Output

    Basic Molecular Dynamics Simulator
    
*** Notes

    Will base this off the miniMD codebase of C.R. Trott at Sandia. This is a minimal molecular dynamics implementation
    capable of EAM and LJ potentials for single-atomtype systems. It has OpenMP and MPI ports (and supports some kind of
    domain decomposition). Unsure about vectorisation capabilities, but presuambly has components which are auto-vectorised
    at a minimum.

    The major classes here are:
    
**** DONE Integrate
     Uses        : Atom, Neighbor, Force, Thermo.
     Description : Integrator for the dynamics. Wrapper around Velocity Verlet.
     Functions   : Setup: Set integration for force step as half the timestep.
		   InitialIntegrate: Half step of velocity and full position update.
		   FinalIntegrate: Half step of velocity update.
		   Run: Wrapper around the full integration. Call InitialIntegrate, update forces then call Final Integrate.
**** TODO Neighbor
     Uses        : Atom.
     Description :
     Functions   :
**** DONE Thermo
     Uses        : Atom, Neighbor, Force.
     Description : Thermodynamics estimators. Temperature and Pressure. No thermostat or barostat here: everything NVE?
     Functions   : Pressure: Instantaneous pressure from virial.
                   Temperature: Instantaneous temperature estimator.
		   Energy: Potential energy estimator.
**** TODO Force
     Uses        :
     Description :
     Functions   :
**** DONE Atom
     Uses        : Neighbor.
     Description : General system container. Initialised once requested density and box volume is known. 
     Functions   : Grow: Wrapper around realloc.
                   PBC: Enforce periodic boundary conditions on simulation cell.
                   Pack/Unpack: Compress/Decompress data in arrays to remove/add any padding. For comm buffers.
                   Sort: For the neighbour list (?)
