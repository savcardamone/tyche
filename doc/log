* Roadmap

** Stage 1

*** Output

    Basic Molecular Dynamics Simulator
    
*** Notes

    Will base this off the miniMD codebase of C.R. Trott at Sandia. This is a minimal molecular dynamics implementation
    capable of EAM and LJ potentials for single-atomtype systems. It has OpenMP and MPI ports (and supports some kind of
    domain decomposition). Unsure about vectorisation capabilities, but presuambly has components which are auto-vectorised
    at a minimum.

    The major classes here are:

**** TODO Integrate

**** TODO Neighbor

**** TODO Thermo

**** TODO Force

**** DONE Atom
     Uses     : Neighbor.
     Function : General system container. Initialised once requested density and box volume is known. 
                Has following functionality:
                   - Grow: Wrapper around realloc.
                   - PBC: Enforce periodic boundary conditions on simulation cell.
                   - Pack/Unpack: Compress/Decompress data in arrays to remove/add any padding. For comm buffers.
                   - Sort: For the neighbour list (?)
